This is the grading rubric for the Site Survey programming assignment.

================
If the program fails to compile, crashes, or hangs then the program
automatically gets a 0.
================

Functionality	     5
 - output for huge.txt matches huge.txt.out 100% (including all whitespace)
 - the program runs on huge.txt in less than 5 seconds

Implementation	    10
 - uses a linked list to store the data
 - sorts the data as it is being inserted in all three sort orders
 - there is only ONE node per data record in the linked list
 - the linked list implements the destructor
 - the linked list implements or explicitly deletes the copy constructor and assignment operator
 - the SensorData class has only three data members and they are the sector,
   iron level, and silicon level
 - the SensorData class has just one constructor and it take the three integer
   values
 - no memory errors or leaks
 - only use char* for string data
 - process.cpp is unchanged

Design		     3
 - there is a class called DataLogger
 - the DataLogger class has a LinkedList data member
 - the DataLogger class doesn't contain any linked-list behavior
 - there is a class called LinkedList
 - the linked list node contains three next chain pointers
 - the linked list node contains a SectorData object
 - there is a class called SensorData

Style		     2
 - each class is defined in a separate file
 - class definition and implementation are in separate files (unless a template)
 - at most 1 return statement per function or method
 - doesn't use of "break" or "continue" in a loop
 - all data members in all classes are private


Total:		    20
